# Urban Harmony Network (UHN)

## Overview

The **Urban Harmony Network (UHN)** is a pioneering IoT with using api ecosystem designed to combat urban mental health deterioration by creating adaptive, healthier city environments. UHN integrates real-time environmental and biometric data with AI-driven predictions and active interventions to mitigate stress caused by urban factors like pollution, noise, and isolation. This project addresses both current urban mental health challenges and future issues like climate-induced heatwaves and increasing urbanization, expected to impact over 1 billion people by 2030.

## Problem Statement

Urban living contributes to mental health issues, with air pollution linked to a 10-20% increase in anxiety/depression, noise pollution causing chronic stress, and limited green spaces fostering isolation. By 2030, 68% of the global population will live in cities, amplifying these issues through climate-driven heatwaves and resource strain. UHN shifts from reactive treatments to preventive, real-time environmental tuning for "self-healing" cities.
