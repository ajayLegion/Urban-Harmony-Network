# Urban Harmony Network (UHN)

## Overview

The **Urban Harmony Network (UHN)** is a pioneering IoT ecosystem designed to combat urban mental health deterioration by creating adaptive, healthier city environments. UHN integrates real-time environmental and biometric data with AI-driven predictions and active interventions to mitigate stress caused by urban factors like pollution, noise, and isolation. This project addresses both current urban mental health challenges and future issues like climate-induced heatwaves and increasing urbanization, expected to impact over 1 billion people by 2030.

## Problem Statement

Urban living contributes to mental health issues, with air pollution linked to a 10-20% increase in anxiety/depression, noise pollution causing chronic stress, and limited green spaces fostering isolation. By 2030, 68% of the global population will live in cities, amplifying these issues through climate-driven heatwaves and resource strain. UHN shifts from reactive treatments to preventive, real-time environmental tuning for "self-healing" cities.

## Features

- **Sensor Layer**: Collects data on air quality (PM2.5, CO2), noise, temperature, humidity, light pollution, crowd density, and urban green space health using low-cost IoT devices.
- **AI Analytics**: Uses machine learning (TensorFlow, Scikit-learn) to predict mental health "hotspots" by analyzing environmental and anonymized biometric trends.
- **Intervention Layer**: Dynamically adjusts urban elements (e.g., cooling systems, lighting, nature sounds) and engages communities via app alerts and gamified incentives.
- **Scalability & Privacy**: Leverages LoRaWAN for connectivity, edge computing for efficiency, blockchain for secure data sharing, and GDPR-compliant anonymization.

## Why It's Unique

Unlike existing IoT solutions that focus solely on monitoring (e.g., pollution alerts) or individual health apps, UHN combines multi-sensor data with AI-driven interventions to proactively enhance urban mental health. No other system creates adaptive, city-scale environments to prevent stress, potentially reducing incidents by 25-40%.

## Technical Architecture

- **Hardware**: Arduino/Raspberry Pi-based sensors with LoRaWAN for long-range, low-power communication ðŸ’¡ Concept Stage.
- **Software**: Python backend with NumPy/Pandas for data processing, Scikit-learn/TensorFlow for ML, and 5G/6G integration for low-latency responses.
- **Security**: Edge processing, zero-knowledge proofs, and blockchain for privacy and trust.
- **Pilot Plan**: Deploy in a high-density urban area (e.g., park or neighborhood), test with simulated data, and scale with volunteer feedback.
