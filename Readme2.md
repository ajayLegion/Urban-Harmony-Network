![Urban Harmony Network Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x300?text=Urban+Harmony+Network)  

## Overview

Welcome to **Urban Harmony Network** – an innovative IoT&Api system designed to monitor and improve urban mental health by tracking environmental factors in real-time. Imagine a city where air quality, noise levels, crowd density, and more are constantly analyzed to predict stress hotspots and suggest interventions. This project turns that vision into reality, using sensors, AI, and blockchain to create healthier urban spaces.

Built with a focus on New York City (initially targeting 20 key locations like Times Square, Central Park, and the Financial District), this system aggregates data from various sources, runs predictive models, and even automates urban infrastructure like traffic lights and air purifiers to reduce stress.

Whether you're a developer, urban planner, or just curious about smart cities, this repo has everything you need to get started, deploy, and contribute.
